# Solaris 11.3+ Chelsio T4/T5/T6 Drivers

NOTE: This is a work in progress... it compiles, but it may destroy your
data, make your system unbootable, or terrorize your pets.  Use at your own risk!

This code was imported from illumos -- https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate
and isolated into a directory suitable for compilation on Solaris 11.4
systems.

## amd64 only

This work only supports AMD64 (which includes Intel systems).  At this
point I have no idea how much Work it would be to make this function in
a SPARC based system.  It might just be updating Makefiles.

## Why? Support?

This work was done on contract, for a client who wants support for these
drivers with their supported Solaris system.  I do not regularly use
Solaris, nor do I own instances of this hardware.  This means that my
own ability to support this work long term is somewhat limited.

## Two drivers

The cxgbe driver is delivered as two pieces.  A thin driver called
cxgbe provides the hooks to the mac layer, and is the ultimate target
driver.  But underneath there is a t4nex driver that has pretty
much the entire set of "real" code.  You need both drivers to
have a functioning system.

## License

The original code is distributed under the terms of the CDDL by Chelsio.
Apparently there is a Chelsio T4 driver for Solaris, but it lacks support
for the T6 chipset.  This work is meant to address that deficiency.

This repository including the local additions and changes I have made are
licensed under the same CDDL terms.  Should Oracle want to use any of this
work, they will first need to get permission from Chelsio.  I will be happy
to discuss making my modifications to this code available to Oracle as
well.  For now they remain under CDDL.
